## New in this Version

Please view the [changelog](https://github.com/mopub/mopub-android-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for details.

  - **Minimum Android version now at API Level 9.** To use the new SDK, your app must run on Android 2.3.1 (Version 9, Gingerbread) or higher.

  - **Simplified APIs for inserting native ads.** See [Native Ads Integration](https://github.com/mopub/mopub-android-sdk/wiki/Native-Ads-Integration) for details.

  - **Automatic ad caching for smooth scrolling.** For native ads, the SDK will now automatically pre-load ads, resulting in smoother scrolling.

  - **Performance improvements** The SDK now makes more efficient use of memory for image caching and avoids allocating temporary objects while scrolling, resulting in fewer garbage collections.
